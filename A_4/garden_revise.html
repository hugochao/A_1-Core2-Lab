      <h2>Times New Roman</h2>
      <br>
      <p> Microsoft has distributed Times New Roman with every copy of Windows since version 3.1
        the operating system released in 1992. Not only was it intrinsic to an embryonic information age, 
        it was also an appropriation of a once excessively grandiose culture. 
        And just as busts of emperors and white marble columns adorn Vaporwave album covers, 
        Times New Roman has become a staple of  Vaporwave – it’s a font that reminds us of our shared 
        relationship techology and plays on the genres accelerationist tendencies.

      <h2>フローラルの専門店</h2>
      <br>
      <p> is the ninth studio album by the American electronic musician Vektroid under the alias Macintosh Plus, 
        released on December 9, 2011 by the independent record label Beer on the Rug. 
        It is her ninth full-length album and was one of the first releases of the 2010s microgenre known as vaporwave to gain popular recognition on the Internet. 
        Since then, Floral Shoppe has been considered by some critics to be the defining album of the style.

      <h2>リサフランク420 / 現代のコンピュー</h2>
      <p> The album's second track, "リサフランク420 / 現代のコンピュー" (Lisa Frank 420 / Modern Computing), 
        has become nearly synonymous with the term "vaporwave" within popular discourse. 
        The song had over 40.5 million views on YouTube before being taken down on April 27, 
        2018, due to copyright claims by Sony Music, and has spawned many covers. 
        The song was later reuploaded to YouTube on May 11, 2018, currently having over 17 million views. 
        The song was used in the Digg video "The Most Satisfying Video in the World".

      <p> Floral Shoppe was met with polarizing reception from critics and casual listeners alike, 
        being equally "criticized and acclaimed for soulless take on muzak".
        Jonathan Dean of Tiny Mix Tapes wrote positively of Floral Shoppe, 
        citing the album as "one of the best single documents of the vaporwave scene yet, 
        a series of estranged but soulful manipulations of found audio that carefully constructs 
        its own meditative headspace through the careful accretion of defamiliarized memory triggers."

    <div class="card">
      <p>YouTube music critic Anthony Fantano's review of the album has been credited with establishing 
        the album as a representative album of the vaporwave subgenre, and also as being a pivotal moment 
        in the decline of the subgenre as a whole. Fantano reviewed the album negatively, 
        rating it 4/10 and concluding "certainly it sounds nice, it has style, 
        but there's really not much there in terms of how it's assembled". 
        <br>
        <br>
        In a 2019 video "10 Times I Changed My Opinion On Albums Pt. 2", 
        Fantano reiterated feelings that the execution of the album was unsophisticated, 
        but noted its influence on later developments in the vaporwave genre, 
        and opined that the songs on the album have "artistic merit independent of the songs actually being sampled".

    <div class="card">
      <p>On the year-end annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll for albums, administered by The Village Voice, 
        the album received two votes. Perfect Sound Forever's Miles Bowe cited Floral Shoppe as one 
        of his year-end best albums. It was also named the sixth-best album of the year by Tiny Mix Tapes, 
        with reviewer James Parker opining that it "slid seamlessly between pure pop pleasure and the ironic 
        framing of that pleasure, the presence of the artist at turns barely noticeable and dramatically foregrounded."

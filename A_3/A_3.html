            <p class="span-half summary">What is DID? Formerly Known as Multiple Personality Disorder.
               International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation characterizes DID by 
               "the presence of more than 1 distinct identity or personality, 
               each of which takes control of the person's behavior at different times."
               <br>
               <br>
               Typically unable to recall important personal information.
               Each identity/personality may possess different and unique name, history, age, and abilities/disabilities.
               Most typically caused by extreme, repeated physical/sexual/emotional abuse.
               Name revised in 1994 to reflect change in professional understanding of disorder.
